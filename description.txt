[h2][b][u]Is this mod compatible with XYZ mod? üéØ[/u][/b][/h2]
Short answer: yes, but:

[h2][b][u]Does this mod work in multiplayer? üåê[/u][/b][/h2]
No. I have not implemented any netcode and haven't tested anything in multiplayer either. The mod most likely breaks down in multiplayer. It might be added later down the line.
(If you want to implement it yourself, feel free to PR to [url=https://github.com/its-truce/DartGunsPlus][b]this repo[/b][/url] . . . good luck dealing with my code)
